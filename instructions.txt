Create a new React project.
Set up a TypeScript configuration for the project.
Create a component called UserList that will serve as the container for displaying the list of users.
Inside the UserList component, make an API call to fetch a list of users from the following endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
Store the fetched user data in the component's state.
Display the list of users in a presentable format. Each user should display their name, username, email, and phone number.
Style the user list to make it visually appealing using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components.
Implement error handling for the API call and display an error message if the request fails.
Create a separate component called UserDetails that will render the details of a selected user when clicked.
When a user from the list is clicked, display the details of that user in the UserDetails component.
Allow the user to go back to the user list view from the UserDetails component.
Write unit tests for at least one component using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library.

Additional considerations:
Use functional components and hooks for implementing the solution.
Pay attention to the component's organization, readability, and maintainability.
Utilize TypeScript to add type safety to your code.
Follow best practices for handling async operations, error handling, and state management.
Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Focus on code quality, including clean and well-structured code, and adherence to best practices.
